// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  PpbTouchAPI.h — the PUBLIC touch interface of Precision Physic Bodies (PPB).
//
//  Copy this single header into your project. It is deliberately self-contained: no
//  CommonLib types, no SKSE types beyond the messaging call you already make, actors are
//  addressed by FormID. Works from any SKSE library (CommonLibSSE, CommonLibVR, classic
//  skse64) because nothing here depends on one.
//
//  ── WHAT YOU GET ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  PPB rebuilds NPC Havok bodies (female AND male since 2.0) as 12 body slots of named
//  collision capsules (~148 per NPC), live-fitted to each NPC's actual mesh. This interface reports CONTACT:
//  who was touched, where (named body part), by which hand, with what (finger / open palm
//  / fist / HIGGS grab / weapon / held object), how close/deep, and for how long.
//
//  Detection is pure geometry against bodies PPB owns (point-to-capsule-surface distance).
//  No Havok contact listeners are involved, so there is no physics cost to consuming this.
//
//  ── ACQUIRING THE INTERFACE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  The same request/reply pattern HIGGS and PLANCK use. Any time at or after kPostLoad:
//
//      PPBAPI::PpbMessage msg{};
//      SKSE::GetMessagingInterface()->Dispatch(PPBAPI::PpbMessage::kGetTouchInterface,
//                                              &msg, sizeof(msg), "PPB");
//      if (msg.GetApiFunction)
//          g_ppb = static_cast<PPBAPI::IPpbTouchInterface1*>(msg.GetApiFunction(1));
//
//  A null GetApiFunction means PPB is not installed (or too old). A null return from
//  GetApiFunction(N) means PPB does not speak revision N — ask for a lower one.
//
//  ── VERSIONING CONTRACT (read this before extending) ─────────────────────────────────
//  * The vtable below is APPEND-ONLY. Methods are never reordered, removed, or changed
//    in signature. A revision bump adds methods at the END, or a new IPpbTouchInterface2.
//  * There is deliberately NO virtual destructor: slot 0 is GetBuildNumber, forever.
//    (The HDT-SMP v1/v2 split taught us what a destructor-at-slot-0 mismatch does: the
//    engine calls your destructor once per event. Not here.)
//  * PpbTouchContact is a fixed-size POD and is also append-only via the reserved tail.
//
//  ── COVERAGE CONTRACT (important) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  PPB drives NPCs of mapped races, BOTH SEXES since 2.0: the human catch-alls (covering
//  elf/orc/etc on a typical load order), Argonian, Khajiit, Draenei (female), plus anything
//  the user adds to PPB_Skeletons_Added_Race.ini. Children and creatures are NOT covered —
//  and neither is anyone at maleGeometry 0 or on an unmapped custom skeleton — all of whom
//  answer IsDriven() = false: route those to your fallback (e.g. CBPC), never assume.
//  Part names are sex- and skeleton-routed (male tables, beast-head tables); consume the
//  name strings, don't assume the female reference map on every actor.
//
//  ── THREADING CONTRACT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  * All interface methods are MAIN-THREAD ONLY, and cheap (snapshot reads).
//  * Touch callbacks fire on the MAIN thread, at most at the configured event rate
//    (apiHz, which SHIPS AT 4/s - it is a host knob, do not assume a rate). Do not
//    block in them.
//  * Papyrus: PPB also fires mod events (below) and exposes polling natives
//    (script "PPB_Touch"), both safe from any Papyrus context.
//
//  ── PAPYRUS MOD EVENTS — TWO STREAMS, pick the one that suits you ────────────────────
//  DIGEST (recommended — grouped, dwell-filtered, one event per region visit):
//      "PPB_TouchStart"   numArg = surface distance in game units (negative = inside)
//      "PPB_Touch"        numArg = distance, re-sent at apiHz while contact holds
//      "PPB_TouchEnd"     numArg = the contact's total DURATION in seconds
//    BODYPART reads "Region(longest part)" e.g. "Face(cheek L)". One contact per
//    (actor, wand, REGION): wandering across five face capsules is ONE event, and the
//    part reported is whichever you spent longest on. Changing your hand pose mid-touch
//    (finger -> fist) does NOT restart it either; SOURCE reports the pose you held longest.
//
//  RAW (verbose — every capsule, every source class, no grouping):
//      "PPB_TouchRawStart" / "PPB_TouchRaw" / "PPB_TouchRawEnd"
//    Same strArg shape, BODYPART is the bare capsule name. Use this if you are building
//    your own aggregation. Host can disable either stream (apiEvents / apiRawEvents).
//
//  sender = the touched NPC (Actor). strArg is a '|'-packed string, split on '|':
//      "WAND|SOURCE|BODYPART|SKELETON"
//       WAND     ∈ L / R
//       SOURCE   ∈ FINGER / PALM / FIST / HAND / GRAB / WEAPON:<name> / OBJECT:<name>
//       BODYPART = the named capsule, side-prefixed on sided slots ("R BREAST R" never
//                  happens — centreline names carry their own side; limb slots get
//                  "L thigh rod" style prefixes). Unnamed children fall back to
//                  "<slot>.C<n>" so a touch is never silently dropped.
//       SKELETON ∈ human / argonian / khajiit / draenei
//  ('|' cannot appear in item names in practice; split on the FIRST three '|' if you
//   want to be bulletproof against exotic OBJECT names.)

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  THE GESTURE EVENT BUS  (added 2026-08-27 with the gesture layer's move into PPB)
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//  The touch API above answers "what is touching what, right now". These SKSE mod events
//  answer a different question: "a hand just DID something to a worn item." They are part
//  of the same published contract and change under the same rules.
//
//  All are SKSE ModCallbackEvents. sender = the ACTOR the gesture happened to (never the
//  player's hand, even when the player's hands did it). Fields are '|'-separated.
//  Consumers must tolerate EXTRA trailing fields: this bus appends, it does not renumber.
//
//  ── OUTBOUND, the five PPB emits ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   PPB_GestureUndressArm      "<capsule>"
//        Both hands have taken the same worn piece and a pull is armed. A consumer that
//        narrates touches should SUPPRESS grab narration on this actor until End.
//
//   PPB_GestureUndressEnd      "<name>|<slotMask>|<done>|<isDD>|<capsule>|<class>"
//        The pull resolved. ⚠ FIRES ON CANCEL TOO (done=0): a hand let go, the actor
//        changed, the piece stopped being worn. The Arm/End PAIR is load-bearing — a
//        consumer that only handles done=1 will silence that actor for the session.
//
//   PPB_GesturePlug            "<in|out>|<name>|<class>|<siteMask>|<leftHand>"
//        THE PLUG GESTURE, both edges, and only the gesture:
//          "in"  a plug was worked into an orifice by hand and equipped
//          "out" a fingertip worked a plug loose (fires just BEFORE the removal)
//        PLUGS ONLY, across every device family. A device qualifies when its DD class is
//        one of the three plug rows (…DeviousPlug / …DeviousPlugVaginal / …DeviousPlugAnal),
//        OR when it carries no DD class at all but its site lands on an orifice — that second
//        arm is what covers ZaZ, Diary of Mine and zRavenous plugs, which have no DD keyword.
//        A gag or a vaginal piercing sits at an orifice SITE but is not a plug and does NOT
//        appear here; use PPB_GestureDeviceEquipped's siteMask for those.
//        <class> is the empty string for a non-DD plug — it genuinely has no class name.
//        <siteMask> is always real: both edges resolve it from the same source the gesture
//        used to find the plug in the first place.
//        A plug leaving by menu, key, or another mod's script does NOT appear here — by
//        design. This event means a HAND did it.
//        ⚠ "out" is emitted just before the removal, and Devious Devices can still refuse it
//        after that point for two reasons PPB cannot see without zadlibs (no class keyword in
//        zadDeviceTypes; GetWornDevice returning None). The common refusal — a quest or
//        block-generic device — is caught in PPB and emits nothing. So a rare "out" with no
//        removal behind it is possible; pair it against the removal, do not assume it.
//
//   PPB_GestureDeviceEquipped  "<name>|<class>|<locked>|<quest>|<siteMask>|<slotMask>"
//        A DD/ZaZ device was put on by the equip gesture.
//
//   PPB_GestureGearEquipped    "<name>|<slotMask>"
//        Plain (non-DD) armor was put on by the equip gesture.
//
//   PPB_GestureClaim           "<actor FormID>"
//        Bookkeeping: the removal a consumer is about to see on TESEquipEvent was OUR
//        gesture, not a menu. Sent immediately before the unequip.
//
//  ── INBOUND, the one event PPB listens for ───────────────────────────────────────────
//   PPB_GestureSetPaused       numArg 1/0
//        Stand the gesture layer down (a scripted scene placing hands must not read as a
//        grab). Equivalent to the Papyrus native PPB_Native.SetGesturePaused(bool), which
//        new callers should prefer.
//
//  ⚠ NOT a gesture event, but it travels this bus: PPB_GestureUnlocked, sent by
//    PPB_DeviceEquip.psc back to PPB with the freed device's FormID. It is an internal
//    round trip. Do not consume it and do not send it.
